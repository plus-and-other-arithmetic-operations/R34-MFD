## R34 Multi Function Display
Fully functional MFD made in LUA for the asc_nissan_r34_nur.

For now, it requires different data.files, as it needs to override the shift up light control

# Installation:

- Set up CM to use unpacked folder and delete the first entry of digital_instruments.ini
- Head over to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\content\cars\asc_nissan_r34_nur\extension`
- Place the downloaded files in the directory, overwriting the old ones.
- Enjoy!


# TO-DO

# Feature Implementation
Stuff that needs to be added to complete the base implementation of the MFD
- [x] Port to new touge version
- [x] Implement select screen with h ell's textures
- [x] Implement shift up screen
- [ ] Port to ks r34 cars

# Gauges
Stuff that needs to be fixed to finalize the gauge implementation
- [x] Correct turbo gauge scale
- [x] Re-code gauge pivot logic using `offset=` - NOT DOABLE FOR NOW, SKILL ISSUE
- [ ] Correct turbo number reading
- [ ] Add small unit text to each gauge
- [x] Maybe generalize gauge functions to simplify code? - NOT DOABLE FOR NOW, SKILL ISSUE
- [x] Tweak circular gauges to make them look less weird on rotation
- [x] Link shift up selection to emissive (use setExtraX and tweak emissive cfg)

# Graph
Stuff that needs to be fixed to finalize the graph implementation
- [ ] Make intercooler temperature/exhaust temperature graphs
- [ ] Code hard limit in boost & other graphs if necessary math.min(314,...)

# Textures
Stuff that needs to be fixed to finalize the visuals
- [x] Get rid of placeholder textures (wait for h ell)
- [ ] Change textures to match the real thing

# Accuracy (making it true to IRL)
Stuff that needs to make the MFD true to its real life counterpart
- [ ] Check outline selection thickness
- [x] Check if memory in selected menus is needed or not (It isn't)
- [x] Correct circular gauge behaviour and layering
- [ ] Find accurate text font

# Misc code improvements
Stuff that needs to be fixed to make the code more compliant to good practices, run faster, etc.
- [ ] Optimize bar menu
- [x] Fix ilja's mess
- [x] Figure out greyed out select screen
- [x] Generalize Menu screen
